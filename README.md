# LoLEsports Capsule Farmer Bot

Are you tired of spending hours watching professional League of Legends games, only to get a few drops? 

This Capsule Farmer Bot is here to farm all League of Legends Esports capsules for you!

# Difference to other farmers

Unlike other bots that use default selenium, which technically can be detected, or browsers without any interface, this bot utilizes the [undetected selenium browser](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver), to ensure undetectability. 

Additionally it actually opens a Chrome browser and watches the Lolesport games, to avoid any shadowbans.
